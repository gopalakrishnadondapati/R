"5","General Information","Comments","The wind turbine system was assembled at Cianbro Constructors in Brewer, Maine, and towed to and moored just outside of Castine Harbour.It will be tested from June 2013 to May 2014. All anchors will also be retrieved in May 2014 once the unit is removed.During the 3 month test the power will be exported to Central Marine Power who are one of the project partners.","","The primary objective of the MAREC wind study assessment is to gain a  better understanding of offshore wind energy, as well as other physical, biological and environmental conditions on the Great Lakes. The research will provide informmichigan offshore wind pilot projectation for the future development of offshore wind energy technology. The project is a significant partnership between MAREC and the University of Michigan’s Phoenix Energy Institute that flows from participation by both organizations on the Great Lakes Offshore Wind Council (GLOW) established by Governor Jennifer Granholm in late 2008.  In May of 2009 the project secured a $1.4 million grant from the U.S. DOE that was added to in early 2009 with a $1.3 million energy efficiency grant from the Michigan Public Service Commission. Subsequent funding needed to complete the project was provided by We Energies and the Sierra Club.","The cost includes the costs of the 30MW project and the export cabling.A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has been signed with Narragansett Electric. The upper limit under the agreement is 24.4 cents per kW/h. Approximate Depths.This pilot could be followed by a 110MW expansion.The transmission grid connection will be subject to a separate determination of competitive interest.The landing point was originally Narragansett Pier but Deepwater withdrew this application after local opposition.","Project will use Keuka Energy's 'Rim Drive' turbine to power a air liquefaction equipment. Liquified air will then be collected by boat, for use onshore.","The project will result in an advanced bottom-mounted foundation design and innovative installation procedures to mitigate potential environmental impacts. Fishermen's has the necessary permits to move forward with the project, it can't begin building the turbines until the BPU approves its application to obtain an Offshore Renewable Energy Certificate, also known as an OREC, which demonstrates its viability. BPU believe the project does not offer sufficient net benefits to the state, though the state Senate pushed through a bill forcing the BPU to approve the project.","This will act as a precursor to the authorised 300MW. The turbine is not authorized to generate power and bring it ashore. It will be unconnected.November 2014 - 3MW to be installedPlan was for the met mast to be replaced with the test turbine on the same foundation. It is was to be a 0.2MW wind translating system.","The project will test the feasibility of the Titan 200 Platform. The platform is available for testing of models in the range 3.6-7MW.The Titan is an offshore jack up platform composed of a unique “Y” shaped hull with a diameter slightly smaller than the wind turbine’s rotor, standing on three legs with a lifting system.  Known as a Dutch Tri-floater design, the platform cannot overturn – if any one arm begins to dip into the water, the other two arms push down to bring it back to horizontal.Three contracted revenue streams are envisioned – potable water to local water districts and enriched brine and chemical feed stock to the agricultural, pharmaceutical, chemical, and general industry as well as electrical power to the grid. Initial investigation and modelling indicates these revenue flows combined with sale of surplus power on the merchant market at prevailing rates can produce attractive equity returns.","Hurricane resilient designTime of Year Restrictions in place:Sea Turtle Nesting on Beaches – May 1 to August 1North Atlantic Right Whale Migration Period – November 1 to April 30","The project is intended to lower the cost of future wind farms in Lake Erie and the project is not expected to turn a profit.The vision is that this project will be followed by subsequent projects with a long-term goal of 1,000 megawatts distributed over several industrial projects in the Ohio waters of Lake Erie by 2025.One of seven projects selected for Offshore Wind Advanced Technology Demonstration Projects(OWATDP) initiative. Three of the seven will be selected to receive $47 funding.On 18/12/2014 DoE awarded a $2.8m grant for the completion of the detailed engineering of the foundation.","One of three sites  selected as an ""Ocean Energy Test Area"", out of an original seven areas. Site is within state of Maine waters. State law allows placement of three wind turbines for a maximum of seven years. Although the capacity is 12MW the application is for 25MW. Usage is limited to a maximum of 2 wind turbines, 3 meteorological towers per wind turbine, one submerged utility line with up to 25 MW capacity, up to 2 wave energy converters, and an ocean sensor package.  The power will go into Monhegan Power District's electricity grid and Central Maine Power Co.'s electricity grid respectively. 300kV of the power will go to Monhegan Island which has high energy costs, with the remainder exported to the mainland.Maine Aqua Ventus plan to install a pilot two 6-megawatt direct-drive turbines on concrete semi-submersible foundations. These concrete foundations could result in improvements in commercial-scale production and provide offshore wind projects with a cost-effective alternative to traditional steel foundations.Electricity has been priced at $230/MWh for 20 years. This is in comparison to $270/MWh that Statoil was proposing for its Hywind project.","Initial project is likely to occupy North Eastern third of lease area, as this is where geotechnical and geophysical surveys were carried out in 2016.Of the 38 OCS Blocks 3, will be for Vineyard Power's needs 40-100MW and the remaining 35 blocks will be for OffshoreMW.One of two bids for areas in the Massachusetts Final Sale. They won area OCS-A 0501.Vineyard Wind was successful in the Section 83C of the Green Communities Act solicitation to develop an offshore wind farm in Massachusetts. The winning Vineyard Wind Bid 2 was for the construction of a 800MW wind farm 15 miles south of Martha's Vineyard.","RES America Developments (Final Sales Notice) won the initial site but sold the area to DONG in April 2015. RES were one of two companies to bid for areas in the Massachusetts Final Sale, winning area OCS-A 0500.","","","Plan to install between 50 to 60 turbines.The cost of the two phases is $720m. The locations of Phase 1 and Phase 2 have been arbitrarily decided by splitting the Lease Tract in half","Project Located off Reheboth Beach.Maximum capacity of Delaware zone could total 450 MW to 600MW. In 2011, NRG Bluewater Wind cancelled a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Delmarva Power for 200MW of the power, blaming congressional decisions to eliminate federal funding for an offshore wind loan-guarantee program and the short term renewals of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC)","Project will use Keuka Energy's 'Rim Drive' turbine to power a air liquefaction equipment. Liquified air will then be collected by boat, for use onshore.Platform will be towed offshore to begin production of liquid air to be stored in the platform which has birthing for 2 cryogenic tankers. Tankers will load and transport the liquid air to a re-gas facility to produce air under pressure to spin turbine driven generators that are grid connected to a Santee/Cooper substation near Andrews, South Carolina.","Makani are developing an airborne wind turbine (AWT).The AWT operates on the same principle as a horizontal wind turbine, but is tethered to the ground like a kite. AWT flies vertical loops and electricity is generated by turbines fitted to wing.Airborne Wind Turbines will operate no higher than 600 meters (1,950 feet) above ground level.Makani have plans to test a prototype offshore.","This project was initially two separate lots, Maryland North and Maryland south. US Wind have combined the areas and given the project a new rating of between 500-600 MW.248MW will use Maryland Offshore Renewable Energy Credits (ORECs)Cost of the 248MW project is $1375mMaryland imports much of its electricity, the Maryland Energy Administration estimates Marylanders pay approximately $250 Million per year in“congestion fees” bundled in their monthly utility bills. “Injecting 750 MW of new power into the Eastern Shore grid will significantly help alleviate this electricity imbalance, and reduce or eliminate much of this hidden tax,” according to US Wind. “Maryland ratepayers are projected to see a net decrease of $2 or more in their monthly bills as a result of US Wind’s project.”","Advanced Floating Turbine (AFT) is designed to minimize costs and operate in offshore conditions.AFT will cut costs by --Having a buoyant tower that transports horizontally and self raises, cutting out the  need for a crane vessel.-Using a single mooring point.Downwind design that prevents blade/tower failures and aligns without a yaw system.-2 bladed turbine-75% less material weight in manufacture.","","As part of Maine state's 3 phase floating offshore wind farms, this is the third phase.","OCS-A 0499 (South)","OCS-A 0498 (North)","These are areas which have been identified in a BOEMRE meeting.","The project is a response to the Call for Information and Nominations (Call) for Commercial Leasing for Wind Power on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Offshore Rhode Island and Massachusetts.Deepwater Wind plans to sell the electricity generated from DWEC to multiple states in the northeast via a transmission system connected to southern New England (Rhode Island, Massachuseutts and Connecticut) and Long Island.On 23rd May 2018 Rhode Island selected Deepwater Wind through a competitive offshore wind procurement process in collaboration with Massachusettsto construct a new, 400MW offshore wind farm. Deepwater Wind will now enter negotiations with National Grid, which will submit a proposed contract to the Public Utilities Commission for regulatory review. On 13th June 2018 Conneticut also selected Revolution wind to supply 200MW of offshore wind capacity in resposne to the RFP issued in April 2018. Deepwater Wind has signed an agreement with the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and National Wildlife Federation (NWF) for additional protections for North Atlantic right whales during pre-construction activities. This includes avoiding all noise producing activities during specific parts of spring and reduced speed limit for all vessels.","","This project will be the first phase of the regional offshore wind farm.Deepwater Wind is also proposing to build 15MW of lithium-ion battery storage technology designed and installed by General Electric.","An extra 7 turbines could be added in a second phase.","","Responded to the Call for Information and Nominations.Virginia Electric and Power Company (Dominion Virginia Power) won the lease auction for the lease area in the Virginia area. It beat 7 other companies although only one other company, Apex Virginia Offshore Wind, LLC,  participated in the lease auction. The winning bid was $1.6m.","The proposed project is a 100-150 MW floating offshore wind farm planned to be located more than 20 miles off the coast of Eureka and use Principle Power Inc's WindFloat technology. In the 'Potential Offshore Wind Energy Areas in California: An Assessment of Locations, Technology, and Costs',  possible offshore wind energy locations in the state of California are examined, reference areas and potential wind plant technologies are selected, and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) between 2015 and 2030 is analyzed. By studying representative technology located at reference wind energy areas, cost and performance characteristics were evaluated. Reference areas were identified as sites that are suitable to represent actual offshore wind projects based on physical site conditions, wind resource quality, known existing site use, and proximity to necessary infrastructure. The intent is to assist decision-making by state utilities, independent system operators, state government officials and policy makers, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and its key stakeholders. The report is not intended to serve as a prescreening exercise for possible future offshore wind development.","In January 2013 the Morro Bay (natural gas) Power Plant was was a major, 650-megawatt powerplant was closed by private company Dynegy, Inc. Closure of this plant created significant negative economic impacts including loss of revenues for public services, job losses and visual detriments.The City owns and controls a cooling water outfall structure previously utilized by the Morro Bay Power Plant, which could be utilized to connect other energy projects to the PG&E electric substation located adjacent to the power plant. This substation provides a crucial interconnection to the high-voltage transmission system that runs through the state to which the offshore wind  project hopes to connect.","","","The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is seeking feedback on identifying new lease areas. Potential Wind Energy Areas including a section from Massachusetts’ Nantucket Sound to New York have been presented by the agency. Specific Requests for Information (RFIs) will be used to solicit input on the call areas.","The size of the initial Wind Energy Area (WEA) was halved after a public consultation. The Wind Energy Area (WEA) was divided into four lease areas during the Proposed Sale Notice (PSN). This is one of the four lease areas.","The size of the initial Wind Energy Area (WEA) was halved after a public consultation.
